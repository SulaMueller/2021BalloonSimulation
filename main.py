@project summary:   
    * calculate BOLD and VASO signals from a given binary stimulus
    * use the model & model parameters suggested by Havlicek2020
@background:
    The human cortex is organized as several individual layers perpendicular to the cortical
    surface. Layer specific fMRI aims to localize brain activity on those layers ("depths"). Two methods 
    are available: BOLD and VASO. VASO is highly specific but suffers from poor SNR and low
    availability. BOLD is widely avaible but specificity is hampered by vascular smearing 
    effects: deoxygenated blood is transported to pial veins at the cortical surface, passing 
    through higher layers. Thus, activation in lower layers causes BOLD-signal in higher
    layers by draining veins.
    Hemodynamic modelling aims to reduce vascular smearing thus retrieve the "clean" 
    stimulus function.

model stages:
    Stimulus: describes whether there is an activating stimulus or not
        -> serves as input to the model
    Neural Activation: reaction of neurons to the stimulus
    Balloon Model: reaction of the vessel system to the neural activation
        - mass balanced equations where inflow = outflow + stored blood for each layer
        - outflow of one compartment serves as inflow to the next
        - venous outflow of one layer is additional inflow to veins on the next layer
        - assumes elastic vessel walls -> blood volume storage capacities
        - 3 properties are relevant for BOLD signal: flow, volume, deoxygenation fraction
    BOLD/VASO signal: MRI measurable signal change

@implementation
scalars:
    numDepths: number of cortical layers (default = 6)
    numCompartments: number of vascular compartments to be considered for the model
            default = 3 
                - arteriole: arterial supply (irrelevant for BOLD signal, but provides input to balloon)
                - venule: microvasculature
                - vein: draining veins
    T: number of time points
    nt: time integration step
    ... many model parameters specified in the model classes

time dependent functions:  [dims]; class they are stored in
    Stimulus: [numDepths, T]; Input_Timeline.stimulus
    Neuronal Activiation Function: [numDepths, T]; Neural_Model.n_excitatory
    Inhibitory Neuronal Response: [numDepths, T]; Neural_Model.n_inhibitory
    Vascular Active Signal: [numDepths, T]; Neural_Model.vas
    Arterial Inflow: [numDepths, T]; Input_Timeline.f_arteriole
    Flow: [numCompartments, numDepths, T]; Balloon.flow  (flow[0,:,:]=f_arteriole)
    Vessel Volume Fraction: [numCompartments, numDepths, T]; Balloon.volume
    Fraction of Deoxygenated Blood: [numCompartments, numDepths, T]; Balloon.q
    BOLD signal: [numDepths, T]; BOLD.BOLDsignal
    VASO signal: [numDepths, T]; BOLD.VASOsignal

classes:
    * Model Parameter Classes:
            -> store all parameters required for model calculation
            -> need parameter files <'file.txt'> as input to init
        - Neural_Parameters: parameters for the neural activiation function
        - Model_Parameters: balloon and bold parameters (info about vessel anatomy, scan parameters etc)
    * Input Class: Input_Timeline
            -> input to the model (can be stimulus or f_arteriole)
    * Model Classes:
            -> do the actual model calculations at init
            -> need previous model stage as input
        - Neural_Model
        - Balloon
        - BOLD
    * convenience classes:
        - Plots
            -> easy access to plot dependencies
            -> can have any/all of the models as input
            -> does not do anything at init, only plots if a callable function is called:
                - plotOverAnother -> needs two functions as input
                - plotOverTime -> plot a single function over time
                - plotAll -> plot a list of functions over time
                (example code provided below)
        - Signal_Model 
            -> summarizes all other classes as Signal_Model.neural_params .params .neural .balloon .bold .plots
            -> needs 3 files as input: parameter_file, neural_parameter_file, input_function_file
            -> gets instances of all models at init
